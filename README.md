# advent-of-code-2022

My solutions for all 25 problems of the [2022 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenge. It was my first time participating, and I learned incredibly much!

## Goals

- Typescript
- 0 dependencies used for solving the problems, only for tooling

## Showcase

For many days, there are also automatically generated outputs, visualizing the problem along the way. Have a look into the respective environment folders, for example [/day-22/test/output-1.txt](https://github.com/andre-brdoch/advent-of-code-2022/blob/animate/src/day-22/test/output-1.txt).

## Getting started

`Node 18` needs to be installed.

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Run day 1
npm run day 1 -- --env=prod

# Run day 1 in watch mode
npm run watch-day 1 -- --env=prod

# Run day 1 with test inputs
npm run day 1 -- --env=test

# Print visualizations
npm run day 1 -- --env=prod --visualize=true

# Surpress terminal logs
npm run day 1 -- --env=prod --noLog=true
```
